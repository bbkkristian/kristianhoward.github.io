                <h3>Character Creator</h3>
                <p>The game features a character creation system where the user can create their first Esport's team member which represents their avatar for the game. We designed this with the intent that the user would have a sense of ownership over their team. The character creation system we made also includes sex, hair options, name, in-game name (IGN), region, biography, and birthday. </p>

                <h3>Stats</h3>
                <p>Stats are crucial to the experience of the game. They determine how the character performance. When creating the first player, his/her stats are randomly generated and can be rerolled.  Different stats are more versatile for different roles. AlsomMatched with specific traits, the game offers opportunity to build a unique character with strategy in mind.</p>

                <h3>Level Up System</h3>
                <p>Once a character has played a certain amount of games, they can achieve a rank up. Once they rank up, stat points would be distributed randomly, mastery cap would increase, and their overall salary would increase. To add to more player interactivity, we gave the player the option to place two extra stat points themselves.</p>

                <h3>UI</h3>
                <p>One of the aspects I contributed to greatly was UI. A great simulation game needs UI elements that balance usability and an organized method of displaying information. We had plenty of design concepts and mockups before we finally were able to create the menu windows. </p>

            <div class = "col-sm-4">
                <h3>Simulation</h3>
                <p>To fully embrace the simulation aspect, a time-system was developed to bring in more elements to the game. The user is able to pause or speed up the flow of time by clicking on the respective icons. </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "col-sm-4">
                <h3>Currencies</h3>
                <p>As the player progresses through the game, he or she will gain many attributes that will show their improvement. There are many variables to incrase, such as the fans the character has, the chemistry with the team, the energy of the character, and his or her salary.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 30px; font-size: 22px"><i>Esports Simulator 2016</i>  had a phenomenal impact on how I approach developing video games. In addition to polishing my scripting skills, being a part of this project taught me valuable lessons on UI Design. The three of us diligently on this game, I could not be more proud of what we created. It is currently on a hiatus due to our current dedications.</p>
